###Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, 'run_analysis.R', does the following:

_  Load the activity and feature files
_  Load both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
_  Load the activity and subject datasets for taining and testing sets, and merges those columns
_  Merges the two datasets, train and test, into one dataset
_  Converts the 'activity' and 'subject' columns into factors
_  Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average of each variable for each subject and each activity
_  The end result is shown in the file tidySet.txt
